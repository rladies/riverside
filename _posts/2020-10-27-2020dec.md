## Data Science as a Team Sport

Hello RiveRside community ;-)

Join us for our next virtual meeting of learning and networking, Thursday, December 10th, at 5:00 PM (PST).

We will hear from [Gabriela de Queiroz](https://k-roz.com/), founder of [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) and [AI Inclusive](https://www.ai-inclusive.org). Gabriela will tell us about her career journey, as well as the many 
different roles a Data Scientist may have. 

At the end of the meeting, there will be time to ask any questions you may have about data scientist careers or questions about R in general.

Don't forget to RSVP in our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-riverside/events/274066116/) to get access to the meeting's ID and password.

Big thanks to UCR Library and UCR GradQuant for supporting us.
