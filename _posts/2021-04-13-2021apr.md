## A Semi-Tidy Tuesday: Dataframe to simple maps

Hello RiveRside community ;-)

Join us for a virtual meeting of networking and learning next Tuesday, April 13th, 12:00 PM (PST). Don't forget to RSVP in our Meetup to get access to the meeting's ID and password.

Whether you are new to R or a data scientist, join us for an introduction to Maps in R. We will introduce a variety of packages to use coordinates from a dataframe and create maps without GIS software.

At the end of the meeting, we will have time to help each other with any R-related questions.

Please have R and RStudio already installed on your computers.

Big thanks to UCR Library and UCR GradQuant for supporting us, and to our guest speaker *Tessa Shates* from the Department of Entomology at UCR!

See you soon!
