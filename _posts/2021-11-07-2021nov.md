## How to Build Portfolio Website with GitHub Pages

Hello, RiveRside community ;-)

Join us for a virtual meeting of networking and learning next Tuesday,
November 9th, at 12:00 PM (PST). Don't forget to RSVP in our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-riverside/events/281706567/)
to get access to the meeting ID and password.

We will learn how to build a portfolio website from scratch with GitHub Pages and Jekyll. This presentation will demonstrate how to create an entirely free, easy-to-maintain, friendly, and secure website.
Please sign up for a GitHub account before the session.

At the end of the meeting, we will have time to help each other with any R-related questions.

Big thanks to UCR Library and UCR GradQuant for supporting us and our guest speaker *Daniela Cassol* from the Department of Botany and Plant Sciences at UCR!

See you soon!
